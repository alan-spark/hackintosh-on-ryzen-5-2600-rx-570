This is an issue with Algrey's PAT patch (and to a much lesser extent, with Shaneee's).
Look under Kernel -> Patch in your config.plist file. Find the two patches called algrey - _mtrr_update_action fix PAT and Shaneee - _mtrr_update_action fix PAT. They should be the last two.
If you are on the TRX40 platform, delete both of these patches.
Otherwise, set the Enabled value of algrey's patch to false, and set the same key to true on Shaneee's patch.
Note that Shaneee's patch can affect HDMI/DP audio quality on some cards and does not work on NVIDIA GPUs.
